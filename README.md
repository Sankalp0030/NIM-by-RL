# NIM Game AI with Q-Learning

This repository contains a NIM game playing AI implemented using the Q-Learning algorithm. The AI learns optimal strategies to play the NIM game through reinforcement learning, continuously improving its performance by learning from each game played.

## Project Overview

The NIM game is a mathematical strategy game where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles. The player forced to take the last object loses. This project's AI uses Q-Learning, a form of reinforcement learning, to determine the best moves based on the state of the game.

## Features

- **AI Training Mode**: Train the AI over multiple sessions and track its improvement.
- **Interactive Game Mode**: Play against the trained AI or watch it play against itself.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Review performance metrics and strategy improvements over time.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nim-game-ai.git
